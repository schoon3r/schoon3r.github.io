  This Github page is a listing of POC of machines from different platforms that I've rooted or exploited. These types of write-ups helped my the start of my journey and here is my way of giving back the same opportunity afforded to me. <br><br> While my write up is not very graphic, I've detailed the commands and steps I've used to ensure that you can recreate my steps towards the same output.
